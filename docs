# Healthcare Record Management on Blockchain

## Overview
This project secures patient records using blockchain technology.  
- Patients can register and access their records.  
- Doctors can upload new medical records.  
- Records are stored using **IPFS hash** for off-chain storage.  

## Architecture
- **Smart Contract (Solidity)** → Stores patient info and IPFS hashes.
- **Backend API (Node.js + Express)** → Acts as middleware between frontend & blockchain.
- **Frontend (React + Web3.js/Ethers.js)** → Patient/Doctor portal.
- **IPFS** → Off-chain record storage.

## Workflow
1. Patient registers on blockchain.
2. Doctor adds medical record with IPFS hash.
3. Patient retrieves own records securely.
