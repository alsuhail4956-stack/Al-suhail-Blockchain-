# 🏥 Healthcare Record Management using Blockchain

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **Blockchain + IPFS** can be used to secure and manage healthcare records.  
It ensures **data integrity, security, transparency, and patient privacy** by leveraging **Ethereum smart contracts** and **decentralized storage (IPFS)**.

- Patients can **register and access** their records.  
- Doctors can **upload new medical records** for patients.  
- Medical files are stored on **IPFS**, while only the file hashes are stored on the blockchain to keep costs low and ensure immutability.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Patient registration on blockchain  
✔️ Doctor registration and record addition  
✔️ Upload medical records securely (stored on IPFS)  
✔️ Patients retrieve and view their records  
✔️ Data is immutable, secure, and transparent
